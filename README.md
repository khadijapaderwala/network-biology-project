# Network Biology

## Description
Protein kinases are a group of enzymes that modify other proteins by covalently
adding phosphates to them in a process called phosphorylation. The target proteins
are phosphorylated at specific sites called residues, usually amino acids serine,
tyrosine or threonine are phosphorylated. Protein kinases also phosphorylate each
other, forming a cell signalling network.

The aim of this practical was to build a kinase signalling network using prior
knowledge, visualise this network in Cytoscape, calculate graph theory metrics and
see how the network can be disrupted by biological disruptions such as mutations.

## Data
The human phosphorylation data was extracted from SIGNOR database: https://signor.uniroma2.it/, an easily
accessible database containing lists of biological interactions available for download.

## Scripts and tools
Scripts for data wrangling were written in Python Jupyter Notebook, generated .SIF files were uploaded into Cytoscape version (3.9.1) to visualise networks.
